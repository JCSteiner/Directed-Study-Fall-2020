Charge 
. Cutter wanted to stand there and demand another Confidet , a good one , and not walk inside , 
politely , like he did . And he wished that his voicewould come out , quickly , with the power 
and hate in it that he had oncebeen capable of . But for some reason , he couldn't say a 
word . Bolen was extremely polite . You've been using that Confidet , haven'tyou ? He spoke gently , almost 
as though he were speaking to a frightenedchild . Yes , Cutter managed to say . And what you expected 
to happen , didn't . That's what you want to tellme , isn't it ? Cutter's insides quivered with rage 
, but he was able only to nod . Would you like to know why ? Bolen said . Cutter 
rubbed his damp palms over his knees . He nodded . Bolen smiled , his eyes sparkling . Very simple 
really . It wasn't thefault of the Confidet so much , Mr . Cutter , as you . You see 
, you are arare exception . What you are , or possibly I should say , what you were ,
